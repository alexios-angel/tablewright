"""Tablewright: a (q)LL(1) parser-generator that emits C++ for the CTLL engine.

Tablewright turns a compact, human-readable grammar into the table of overloaded
``rule`` functions that drives CTLL, the compile-time LL parser at the heart of
Hana Dusíková's Compile-Time Regular Expressions library
(https://github.com/hanickadot/compile-time-regular-expressions). CTLL runs a
pushdown automaton entirely at compile time, selecting productions by overload
resolution over rules shaped like::

    static constexpr auto rule(State, ctll::term<'c'>) -> ctll::push<...>;

Given a grammar in the ``.gram`` dialect, this module produces exactly that
header.

Origin and attribution
-----------------------
The grammar format and the original tool are Hana Dusíková's work, not mine.
Hana built CTRE/CTLL and an in-house utility called *Desatomat* that transforms a
grammar into the (q)LL(1) ``rule`` table CTLL consumes. Her Desatomat is closed
source and runs publicly at
https://www.desatomat.cz/?lang=desatomat&langui=en . As she explained in
https://github.com/hanickadot/compile-time-regular-expressions/issues/37 :

    "Desatomat is an utility to transform grammar to different form. You don't
    need it to design your own grammar as long as you are able to write LL1
    table. I can't open-source it and I don't have time to write proper
    replacement as I would want."

Tablewright is my attempt at that replacement: an independent, open-source
re-implementation built by reverse-engineering the input/output format from
CTRE's published headers. It is not derived from Hana's source and is not
affiliated with or endorsed by her; any differences from the original Desatomat
are mine. The ``.gram`` dialect below mirrors the format her tool accepts so the
two are interoperable in practice.

The grammar dialect
-------------------
A ``.gram`` file is a sequence of *set definitions* and *rules*::

    name = {a, b, c}        # a positive character class (a named terminal)
    name = sigma - {a, b}   # a negative class: any character except those listed
    A -> <B>, x, [act] | epsilon

In a set definition the assignment operator may be written as ``=`` or ``:``
(they are equivalent), and the braces around the members are optional, so
``name = {a, b, c}``, ``name : {a, b, c}``, ``name = a, b, c`` and
``name : a, b, c`` all define the same terminal (and likewise for the
``sigma -`` negative form).

The production operator joining a nonterminal to its rules may be written as
``->`` or ``:`` (they are equivalent), so ``A -> <B> | x`` and ``A : <B> | x``
mean the same thing. Because ``:`` also introduces a set definition, a statement
of the bare form ``name : a, b, c`` (a comma list of single-character atoms with
no nonterminal, string, range, or ``|`` alternation) is read as a *set* for
backward compatibility; to write such a rule with ``:`` give it a rule-shaped
body (a ``<nonterminal>``, a ``"string"``, a ``[[range]]``, a ``|``, or the
``epsilon`` keyword), or simply use ``->``.

In a rule body, ``<B>`` references another nonterminal, a bare character such as
``x`` is an atom, ``[act]`` is a semantic action, ``"abc"`` is a string literal
(expanded later into the atoms ``a``, ``b``, ``c``), ``|`` separates
alternatives and ``,`` separates the symbols of one alternative. ``epsilon``
(or ``@``) denotes the empty production. Nonterminal *names* must be at least
two characters, because a single ``<X>`` is reserved syntax.

A rule body may also contain a regex-style character range written in double
brackets, e.g. ``[[a-zA-Z]]`` or ``[[abcg-i]]``. A range expands inline into a
positive set with every member character enumerated (``[[a-c]]`` becomes the set
``{a, b, c}``); spans may be combined and mixed with literals, and an escaped
dash (``\\-``) is a literal. A ``^`` as the first character negates the range:
``[[^\\nabc\\r\\0]]`` matches any character *except* the six listed, emitted as
a ``ctll::neg_set`` just like a named ``sigma -`` set. A ``^`` that is escaped
(``\\^``) or not in first position is an ordinary literal.

Wherever a single character can appear (an atom, a set member, a string-literal
character, a range item), it may be spelled with an escape: the control escapes
``\\n \\t \\r \\f \\v \\0 \\a \\b``, a hex escape ``\\xNN`` (exactly two hex
digits) or ``\\u{H..H}`` (one to six hex digits, up to U+10FFFF), or a backslash
before any other character for that literal character. Non-ASCII characters may
also be typed directly; grammar files are read as UTF-8. A malformed hex escape
keeps the old reading (``\\x`` is a literal ``x``).

Rule bodies further support regex-style *grouping* and *repetition*. A
parenthesized grouping ``(<expr> x)`` brackets a sequence of symbols (separated
by commas or just whitespace), and the quantifiers ``+`` (one or more) and ``*``
(zero or more) may follow an atom, a ``"string"``, a ``[[range]]``, a named
terminal, a ``<nonterminal>`` or a grouping. Both are pure syntax sugar,
rewritten before any analysis into an anonymous right-recursive helper::

    S -> a+        becomes    S -> a, <a_anon>
                              a_anon -> a, <a_anon> | @

    S -> a*        becomes    S -> <a_anon>
                              a_anon -> a, <a_anon> | @

Because ``( ) * +`` are also ordinary characters in many grammars, the sugar is
recognized only where it is structurally unambiguous: a ``*`` or ``+`` is a
quantifier only when it immediately follows a quantifiable symbol (so the
stand-alone atoms in ``S -> (, a, ), *`` keep their old meaning), and inside a
grouping -- where whitespace alone separates items -- the structural characters
``, ( ) < > [ ] | " * + @`` must be escaped (``\\(``, ``\\*``, ...) to be
literals. Outside groupings nothing changes and existing grammars parse as
before.

Parser model
------------
By default Tablewright targets a *Q-grammar*, the relaxation CTLL relies on: when
a terminal is in both FIRST and FOLLOW of a nonterminal, the shift rule wins and
epsilon is the fallback. Pass ``--no-q`` / ``--strict`` to require classic LL(1)
instead, where any FIRST/FIRST or FIRST/FOLLOW overlap is a conflict.

Optimization
------------
The ``-O0``..``-O3`` flags trade generation effort for a smaller table, in the
spirit of a C++ compiler's optimization levels. Every level preserves the
recognized language and the chosen parser model (``-O1`` merges identical
nonterminals, ``-O2`` also inlines single-use ones, ``-O3`` also inlines
single-alternative ones). Because each distinct ``rule`` overload adds to the
overload set the compiler must resolve per input character, these state-reducing
passes are the most effective lever on compile time -- on the bundled PCRE
grammar, ``-O3`` compiles its parser noticeably faster than ``-O0``.

``--range-lookaheads`` is a separate, opt-in transform grounded in interval
covering: a wide positive lookahead set is split into maximal contiguous spans,
each emitted as a ``ctll::range<lo,hi>`` rule (two ordered comparisons) instead
of a single wide ``ctll::set`` (one equality comparison per member). It is
language-preserving and verified against CTRE's full test suite, and it sharply
cuts the number of compile-time character comparisons and the width of the
largest set types. Note the trade-off, though: it replaces one rule with several,
which enlarges the overload set, and for the CTLL/GCC target that overload cost
outweighs the comparison saving, so it tends to *increase* overall compile time.
It is therefore off by default and most interesting for other back ends, very
large alphabets, or compilers whose set-membership cost dominates.

Pipeline
--------
``main`` wires the stages together::

    .gram text
      -> Lark parse                       parse the .gram dialect
      -> tree transforms                  strip whitespace, build GrammerTypes
      -> identifier table                 collect nonterminals/terminals/actions
      -> verify + break string literals   "abc" -> a, b, c
      -> eliminate left recursion
      -> left factoring (to a fixed point)
      -> compute the global "other" set
      -> inline pure character-class helpers
      -> (optional) -O optimization passes
      -> FIRST / FOLLOW / (q)LL(1) parse table
      -> render the CTLL header

Command-line usage
------------------
In the common case only the input and output are needed -- the namespace, header
guard, output filename and grammar-struct name all default to names derived from
the input filename (``pcre.gram`` -> namespace ``pcre``, guard ``PCRE_HPP``,
file ``pcre.hpp``)::

    python tablewright.py --input pcre.gram --output include/

Any of those can still be set explicitly, and other options layered on::

    python tablewright.py --input pcre.gram --output include/ \\
        --namespace ctre --guard CTRE__PCRE__HPP --grammar-name pcre -O3

To validate a grammar without generating anything (useful in CI or while
iterating), use ``--check`` (alias ``--validate``); it parses the grammar,
checks for undefined symbols and (q)LL(1) conflicts, and exits nonzero if the
grammar is invalid. ``--syntax`` prints a quick reference for the ``.gram``
dialect. A malformed grammar reports the offending line and column with a caret
and a plain-language list of what was expected there.

Debugging and logging
---------------------
The pipeline logs its progress; raise the verbosity to inspect what it is doing:

* ``--verbose`` (DEBUG) prints the grammar at each stage, the FIRST/FOLLOW sets,
  the full parse table, what each optimization pass changed, and the terminal
  aliasing summary;
* ``--trace`` adds per-item detail: every FIRST/FOLLOW propagation worth noting,
  each Q-grammar shift/epsilon resolution, every merge/inline, and every alias
  assignment;
* ``--quiet`` limits output to errors;
* ``--log-file PATH`` also writes a full, timestamped log to a file;
* ``--dump-stages DIR`` writes each intermediate grammar (original, after
  left-recursion removal, after factoring) and the final header to ``DIR`` as
  text files for inspection;
* ``--stats`` prints a per-stage wall-clock timing summary when finished.

For grammar diagnostics specifically:

* ``--analyze`` prints a health report before generating: nullable nonterminals,
  plus warnings for unreachable or unproductive nonterminals, declared-but-unused
  terminals, and duplicate productions;
* ``--explain NONTERMINAL`` traces a single nonterminal end to end -- its
  productions, FIRST/FOLLOW, parse-table row and the emitted ``rule`` overloads --
  then exits without writing output;
* ``--debug-json PATH`` writes the finalized grammar, FIRST/FOLLOW, parse table,
  terminal-alias map and analysis to a JSON file for diffing or other tooling.

Tablewright ships with a built-in test suite (standard-library ``unittest``); run
it with ``--run-tests``, which exercises the data structures, FIRST/FOLLOW and
parse-table maths, grammar analysis, the terminal aliaser and a full
grammar-to-C++ integration path, then exits with a pass/fail status.

Grammar conflicts are reported as a clear one-line error (with a side-by-side of
the competing productions for same-lookahead clashes) instead of a traceback.

Run ``python tablewright.py --help`` for the full set of flags.

    character *except* the listed ones (an escaped ``\^``, or a ``^`` anywhere
    else, is an ordinary literal). The rest of the body is read left to right as
    a sequence of items, each either a single (optionally backslash-escaped)
    character or a ``start-end`` span. A span enumerates every character whose
    code point lies between ``start`` and ``end`` inclusive; the endpoints may
    themselves be escaped (e.g. ``\]-\^``). A literal ``-`` is produced when it
    is escaped (``\-``) or appears where it cannot start a span -- at the very end
    of the body, or immediately after a completed span.

# Tablewright's own regular-expression parser. The Lark frontend meets

# rules; translating them into EDS -- which knows atoms, ``[[...]]``
# character sets, ``"strings"``, ``+``/``*`` repetition and ``|``
# alternation -- requires understanding the pattern structurally, not
# textually. This parser produces the same ``("seq" / "alt" / "quant" /
# "charset")`` node language the external frontends lower, so a parsed
# pattern drops straight into the EDS emitter.
#
# Only the language-defining subset is accepted. Constructs that select
# match *positions* rather than characters -- anchors, word boundaries,
# lookarounds, backreferences -- have no counterpart in a context-free
# rule and are rejected with a pointed error instead of being silently
# mistranslated. Greedy/lazy markers are accepted and ignored (they change
# which match is *preferred*, never which strings are *matched*), while
# possessive quantifiers are rejected (they do change the language).

    drops straight into the EDS emitter and from there into the C++ table.

    The supported subset is the language-defining core of Python/Lark
    regexes: literals, ``.``, character classes (ranges, negation, the

    grouping (plain, non-capturing and named), alternation, the ``? * +``
    quantifiers and counted ``{n}``/``{n,}``/``{n,m}`` repetition, plus the
    ``i``, ``s`` and ``x`` flags. Anchors, word boundaries, lookarounds,
    backreferences, possessive quantifiers and inline flags are rejected

Tablewright .gram syntax quick reference
========================================

A grammar is a sequence of terminal (set) definitions and rules.

Terminal sets
-------------
  name = {a, b, c}        a positive set: matches a, b or c
  name = a, b, c          braces are optional
  name : a, b, c          ':' works the same as '='
  name = sigma - {a, b}   a negative set: matches any character except a, b

Rules
-----
  A -> <B>, x, [act] | epsilon
  A : <B>, x, [act] | epsilon      ':' works the same as '->'

  <B>        reference to nonterminal B   (names must be 2+ characters)
  x          a single literal character (an atom)
  "abc"      a string literal (expands to atoms a, b, c)
  [[a-z]]    a regex-style range (expands to a positive set)
  [[^abc]]   a negated range: any character except those listed; a leading
             '^' negates, an escaped '\\^' or non-leading '^' is a literal
  [act]      a semantic action named 'act'
  |          separates alternatives
  ,          separates the symbols of one alternative
  epsilon    (or '@') the empty production

Escapes (atoms, set members, strings, ranges)
---------------------------------------------
  \\n \\t \\r \\f \\v \\0 \\a \\b    the usual control characters
  \\xNN                       code point NN (exactly two hex digits)
  \\u{H..H}                   code point (1-6 hex digits, up to U+10FFFF)
  \\c                         any other escaped character is that literal
  Non-ASCII characters may also be typed directly (files are read as UTF-8).

Repetition and grouping
-----------------------
  X+         one or more X:   S -> a+   =   S -> a, <a_anon>
                                            a_anon -> a, <a_anon> | @
  X*         zero or more X:  S -> a*   =   S -> <a_anon>  (same helper)
  (X Y)      groups a sequence; items separated by commas or whitespace
  (X Y)*     a grouping may itself be quantified

  X may be an atom, "string", [[range]], named terminal, <nonterminal>,
  or (grouping). A '*' or '+' is a quantifier only right after such a
  symbol; standing alone (e.g. 'S -> a, *, b') it is still a plain atom.
  Inside a grouping, escape , ( ) < > [ ] | " * + @ to use them as
  literal characters (\\(, \\*, ...).

Notes
-----
  * '#' starts a comment to end of line.
  * A bare 'name : a, b, c' (only atoms) is read as a set, not a rule;
    give a rule a <nonterminal>, "string", [[range]] or '|' to disambiguate,
    or just use '->'.

Example
-------
  digit  = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
  number -> digit, <number_tail>
  number_tail -> digit, <number_tail> | epsilon

#    ',' concatenation, '|' alternation, '[x]' optional, '{x}' repetition,
#    '(x)' grouping, 'n * x' repetition factors and the 'x - y' exception.
#    '::='/':' and a '.' terminator are accepted as common variants, and
#    the '? * +' postfix quantifiers remain as extensions.
#
#  * W3C style (--lang=w3c, the XML-specification notation): terminator-less
#    ``Name ::= expression`` rules, juxtaposition for sequence, character
#    classes ``[a-z#xB7]`` / ``[^...]``, ``#xNN`` code-point references,
#    postfix '? * +' and the 'A - B' exception. Parsed with Earley: without
#    terminators, where one rule ends and the next begins is only decidable
#    from the following '::=' -- global context a deterministic parser
#    cannot see.
#
# Exceptions are translatable exactly when both operands denote character
# sets (classes, single characters, references to rules that reduce to
# them); the difference is computed at conversion time and anything else is
# rejected with an explanation, never mistranslated.

# (inline whitespace, comments) must never apply inside a pattern. The
